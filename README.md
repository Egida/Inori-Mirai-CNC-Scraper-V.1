### A working Mirai CNC scraper written in python.

## How does it work?:
```bash
Scrapes Mirai CNC servers off URLHaus. Then checks each server for a running MYSQL server on port 3306. 
Once it finds a running server it attempts to login the MYSQL server using default credentials.
After a successful login, it dumps the all the databases specifically the users table in each database.
